Health Insurance Cost Prediction
This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict the medical insurance costs based on various features such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. Using the insurance dataset, we explore and preprocess the data, train a Linear Regression model, and evaluate its performance.

Key Steps:
-----------
Data Collection & Analysis:

Load the dataset and examine its structure and content.
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distributions and relationships between features.

Data Pre-Processing:

Encode categorical features such as sex, smoker, and region using numerical values.
Splited the data into features (X) and target variable (Y).

Splitting the Data:

Divided the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
Model Training:

Trained a Linear Regression model on the training data.
Model Evaluation:

Predict insurance costs on both training and testing data.
Calculate the R-squared value to measure the model's performance.

Building a Predictive System:

Implement a system to predict insurance costs for new input data.



Conclusion
-----------
This project demonstrates the process of building a linear regression model to predict health insurance costs based on various demographic and lifestyle factors. The model achieved an R-squared value of 0.751 on the training data and 0.744 on the test data, indicating a good fit and generalization to unseen data. Further improvements can be made through feature engineering, advanced modeling techniques, and hyperparameter tuning.
